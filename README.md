AI TRANSLATE ANY AUDIO TO TEXT

WHISPHER:

Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets.

SETUP:

We used Python 3.9.9 and PyTorch 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably OpenAI's tiktoken for their fast tokenizer implementation. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command:

pip install -U openai-whisper

pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 

PYTHON USAGE:

import whisper
model = whisper.load_model("base")
result = model.transcribe("audio.mp3")
print(result["text"])

Internally, the transcribe() method reads the entire file and processes the audio with a sliding 30-second window, performing autoregressive sequence-to-sequence predictions on each window.

Below is an example usage of whisper.detect_language() and whisper.decode() which provide lower-level access to the model.
import whisper

model = whisper.load_model("base")
# load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds
audio = whisper.load_audio("audio.mp3")
audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio)
# make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model
mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device)
# detect the spoken language
_, probs = model.detect_language(mel)
print(f"Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}")
# decode the audio
options = whisper.DecodingOptions()
result = whisper.decode(model, mel, options)
# print the recognized text
print(result.text)
